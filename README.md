## Abstract
> Fog computing is a promising option for time sensitive vehicular over-the-air (OTA) updates, as it can offer enhanced network durability and lower communication delays, versus the cloud. Fog node utilization is non-deterministic, largely owing to vehicular traffic patterns. The resultant over provisioning of resources manifests itself in increased communication and handover delays. Based on an analysis of regional traffic patterns, our proposed algorithm determines the optimal number of fog nodes required for OTA updates. The efficacy of our proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study that considers handover delay, propagation delay, transmission rate and vehicular mobility to predict the OTA update time. We employ a machine learning model for predicting the communication delay between fog devices and vehicles. Using European WiFi hotspot signal strength NYC dataset and 5G dataset, we observe that the proposed approach increases net reserve fog resources by 26.57% on average, and reduces the OTA update time by 5.34%. We test the scalability of our approach by analyzing the performance in terms of average throughput while varying the number of vehicles and OTA update size. The performance of the proposed OTA update scheme on simulations has been corroborated by implementation on a real-world testbed
